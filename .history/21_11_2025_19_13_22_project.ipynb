    "- Using boxplots on a log10 y-scale makes the skewed price distribution easier to compare and helps spot group-level differences and heteroscedasticity that are important for later inference.\n",
    "##### Interpret briefly the results obtained.\n",
    "- `entire` Airbnb offers show substantially higher medians and much wider variability than `private` or `shared` offerings, and the `entire` category contains extreme high-price outliers that extend far above the rest of the distribution.\n",
    "- `shared` appears very narrow and has few observations.\n",
    "- Lastly, we notice the two `day_type` fills is **associated with** only small within-group shifts in medians, suggesting weekday/weekend differences exist but are not huge in these raw comparisons.\n",
    "##### Interpret briefly the results obtained.\n",
    "- The visualization suggests `room_type` and `num_host_offers` are promising predictors to include (and possibly interact) in a regression for inference, and it justifies the log-transform of price.\n",
    "- It also reveals various problems to address in modelling, such as strong right skew and outliers, unequal group sizes, and confounding from variables that we haven't explored yet.\n",
